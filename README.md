# Docker

## What is Docker

- Docker allows developers to put different pieces of softwares within containers
- It keeps these pieces separate from each other inside virtualised containers
- Docker automatically includes all the necessary dependecnies and libraries. No need to manually install them
- It will always run the same everywhere, on everyone's machine.

Think of it as a lunchbox, you can hold different types of foods and keep them separate and organised within the same box. You can eat them at lunchtime separately without finding the sauce from your sandwich on your cookie (no one wants that).

Best part is that Docker lunchbox is really smart and it adds the perfect sauce or dressing to each items because your lunchbox (docker) knows what each item needs and it just takes care of it.
